To-Do:

One tower per tile (upon drag & drop, tower snaps to be placed in the middle)
Show range of towers on click & drag

As it stands, monsters can't be attacked in their original square, as they haven't yet notified the tile of their presence

Objects like tower and monster should have their row, col as properties, rather than having to calculate it every frame

Targeting system: walk backwards through the path and attack the first one there!

Tower type: line directly to monster, damages per second


Deselect tower upon drag & drop
github html?

Scrolling -5 text for tower purchase

sendMonster(ofType, toSide) function for easy monster adding

Press keys to select a tower type to buy/monster type to send (press 1 means tower type 1 appears at mouseX, mouseY if enough gold)

Note: if maps change, BFS code must perform separate searches for each context

When drawing a dragged tower, don't make an actual tower object, too much -- just need the image, object is created if necessary when placed


Income from sending monsters

Increase tower building probability the more monsters are on screen

Money if monster reaches end (lives?)
