To-Do:

Draw mini-sized pictures for tower & monster selections so they fit

Debug button for delete all monsters/towers

As it stands, monsters can't be attacked in their original square, as they haven't yet notified the tile of their presence

Objects like tower and monster should have their row, col as properties, rather than having to calculate it every frame

Tower type: line directly to monster, damages per second

Press keys to select a tower type to buy/monster type to send (press 1 means tower type 1 appears at mouseX, mouseY if enough gold)

Note: if maps change, BFS code must perform separate searches for each context

Increase tower building probability the more monsters are on screen

Money if monster reaches end (lives?)

Tower targeting: update if a monster passes their target

Info pane is constant on the right side, changes context based on what's selected

Highlight tower & monster different color if you can afford


If this turns into a bigger game, can have two campaign paths: first you do normal TD, then you do sending monsters, then you get the combined mode

Sell button

Customize enemy probabilities based on difficulty

Find a way to prioritize tower placement to the middle

Calculate some sort of "safety" ratio for the enemy. The more safe it feels, the more likely it is to perform offensive actions

Select from one tower to another

Consider highlighting drag & drop all white or red based on whether current tile is valid

Increase efficiency of random selection: instead of while(1000), pick a spot randomly and iterate across the list until found -- better worst case, similar average

Change tower upgrades into a single upgrade that improves various aspects -- tiers

Fix snapping at corners during monster movement

Enemy starts off with some towers? (prevents rushes)

Only draw explosion animation if tower is upgraded to splash

Alternate enemy behaviour: randomly choose something to do, and save up enough money to do it!

Prioritize towers less as you have more

Some sort of "leading" for the non-tracking projectiles (otherwise they lag)

Target priorities! Last, first, close, strong

Ideas for tier trees: single target, AOE, and support (e.g., hits do not more damage, but slow run speed or increase damage taken from other sources)

If you want to be really fancy, instead of highlighting the square a tower is on, overlay a shade onto the image itself


Notes:
Cannon explosion animation from https://www.photopea.com/, select region with lasso, move with V -- make sure specific layer is selected
