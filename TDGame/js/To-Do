To-Do:

One tower per tile (upon drag & drop, tower snaps to be placed in the middle)
Show range of towers on click & drag

As it stands, monsters can't be attacked in their original square, as they haven't yet notified the tile of their presence

Objects like tower and monster should have their row, col as properties, rather than having to calculate it every frame
