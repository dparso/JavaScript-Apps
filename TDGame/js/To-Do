To-Do:

One tower per tile (upon drag & drop, tower snaps to be placed in the middle)
Show range of towers on click & drag

As it stands, monsters can't be attacked in their original square, as they haven't yet notified the tile of their presence

Objects like tower and monster should have their row, col as properties, rather than having to calculate it every frame

Targeting system: walk backwards through the path and attack the first one there!

Tower type: line directly to monster, damages per second

Explosion animation for cannon shots

Press keys to select a tower type to buy/monster type to send (press 1 means tower type 1 appears at mouseX, mouseY if enough gold)

Note: if maps change, BFS code must perform separate searches for each context

When drawing a dragged tower, don't make an actual tower object, too much -- just need the image, object is created if necessary when placed


Income from sending monsters

Increase tower building probability the more monsters are on screen

Money if monster reaches end (lives?)

Tower targeting: update if a monster passes their target

Info pane is constant on the right side, changes context based on what's selected

Highlight tower & monster different color if you can afford


If this turns into a bigger game, can have two campaign paths: first you do normal TD, then you do sending monsters, then you get the combined mode

Tower keeps firing at monster after it gets to end

Sell button

Customize enemy probabilities based on difficulty

Find a way to prioritize tower placement to the middle

Calculate some sort of "safety" ratio for the enemy. The more safe it feels, the more likely it is to perform offensive actions

Select from one tower to another

Consider highlighting drag & drop all white or red based on whether current tile is valid

Increase efficiency of random selection: instead of while(1000), pick a spot randomly and iterate across the list until found -- better worst case, similar average


Fix snapping at corners during monster movement

Enemy starts off with some towers? (prevents rushes)


Notes:
Cannon explosion animation from https://www.photopea.com/, select region with lasso, move with V -- make sure specific layer is selected
